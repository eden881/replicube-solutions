# Replicube Solutions

My personal collection of solutions for the awesome game
[Replicube](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3401490/Replicube/). In this game
you write code to recreate 3D objects made out of voxels.

This is still very much a work in progress. Sometimes I also include some
alternate solutions if I find them neat.

Feel free to do whatever you want with this. However don't expect things to be
well-optimized (or optimized at all)!
